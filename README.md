# PyBer_Analysis

## Analysis
The purpose of this Analysis was to take a dataset that provided information about different transportation types in different types of cities. 
The different city subcategories are Rural, Urban, and Suburban. 

## Results 
![Total Fare Graph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109381647/196814439-3ca5dec8-371f-4797-9614-2e3ca3aeb320.png)

The results show that the graphs stay consistent with the city types. The urban ride fares are higher, while the rural prices stay at the bottom. 
Meanwhile suburban stays right in the middle. 

## Summary

My recommendation would be to focus on the the Urban and Suburban city types as they generate the most revenue. It is clear that the rural subcategory did not generate the same income.
